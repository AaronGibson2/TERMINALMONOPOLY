# Comments

Use comments sparingly and ensure they add value. They should explain why something is done and its contribution to the project as a whole.
Use # for inline comments. Leave a space between the # and the comment.

# Docstrings

Every public module, function, class, and method must have a docstring.
Use triple double quotes (""") for docstrings.
For short one-liners, keep the closing quotes on the same line.

# Functions

Functions should do one thing and do it well.
Keep functions small and modular to promote reuse and testing.

# Branching Strategy

Use meaningful branch names like:
feature/add-dice-method or bugfix/fix-gamelogic-error
