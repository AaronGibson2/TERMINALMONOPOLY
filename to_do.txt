Clock:
    need to get the minutes to incrememnt by 1 really quickly instead
    of incrementing by 12 every second so it resembles something like
    changing quickly on a stopwatch

Display:
    need to work out how we want to display all of this in the terminal

Terminal:
    need to work out terminal commands/what commands we want
    (ex: buy, sell, stop loss, etc...)
