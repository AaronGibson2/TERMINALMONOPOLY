Clock:
    need to get the minutes to increment by 1 really quickly instead
    of incrementing by 12 every second so it resembles something like
    changing quickly on a stopwatch

Display:
    need to work out how we want to display all of this in the terminal

Terminal:
    need to work out terminal commands/what commands we want
    (ex: buy, sell, stop loss, etc...)

    Need to work on using the set cursor to have the stock/portfolio update on the same lines in the terminal



    PROBLEM: what to do when stocks go to values less than or equal to zero
    SOLUTION: bankrupt company? we need actual risk
    parameters to declare bank
    market cap :(

    --> do you want to make it go to 0.0001?
