# Getting Started with Terminal Monopoly

### Step 0: what you'll need
- Code editor of your choice (recommended: **VS Code**)
- Python installed in your system (minimum ver. **Python 3.10**)
- [A fork of the repository](https://github.com/ufosc/TERMINALMONOPOLY)

### Step 1: forking a repository
![fork](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a71ea542-0236-4051-8076-07e414d0934c)

- [ ] Go to https://github.com/ufosc/TERMINALMONOPOLY
- [ ] Press the "fork" button in the top right
- [ ] (Feel free to "star" the repository as well at this point!)

![fork2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ae61df2-a32d-47d1-9fbd-ae62f3c2e011)
- [ ] Create a name for your fork (default is usually fine) and add a description
- [ ] Create fork

![uptodate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f7f6b34-a70c-41a9-8670-e8a15689c926)
- [ ] Ensure the newly created branch is up to date with ufosc/TERMINALMONOPOLY:main
- [ ] If not, press "sync fork"

### Step 2: cloning the fork

*Different code editors have different features, but most have Github integrations or extensions you can work with. If not, you can always use the command line commands listed here.*

- [ ] Navigate to a directory in your file system where you want to save everything. **cd <directory name>** to switch directories
- [ ] Clone git repository using code editor feature or in the command line: **git clone <URL to your newly created fork>**
- [ ] Once cloned, git pull using code editor or in the command line: **git pull** (no parameters). This ensures you are up to date.

### Step 3: working on a branch  
Create a new branch with a descriptive (but short) title regarding what you're working on
- [ ] Use code editor feature or command line: **git branch <name>**
- [ ] Additionally, you can always use **git branch** to view all your local branches
- [ ] To switch to your newly made branch, use **git checkout <name>**
Once you're working in the new branch, you can make new changes locally without messing up your main branch
