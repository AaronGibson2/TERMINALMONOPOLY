## The last game your computer will play...

# What is TERMINALMONOPOLY? 
Terminal Monopoly is a rapid-pace, eclectic game which merges a classic board game with retro graphics, while satisfying the modern need of constant stimulation. Played entirely over a computer's command line, Terminal Monopoly brings nostalgic feelings of ancient terminal games on the first computers, while ensuring anyone can play due to the minimal graphical and computing requirements.

Terminal Monopoly is only 25% board game. Inspired by inane but hilarious Yakuza-type side quests, overcomplicated mechanics like in Cookie Clicker, and minigames such as those in Mario Party, Terminal Monopoly has so much more to offer than just rolling dice.

Terminal Monopoly is written entirely in Python. The source code is available on GitHub.

An initial release of Terminal Monopoly is expected to be completed by the end of Fall 2024 (roughly December).

# Workflow

1. Start by reviewing the [issues list](https://github.com/ufosc/TERMINALMONOPOLY/issues) and pick a task or propose a new feature.

2. Go to https://github.com/ufosc/TERMINALMONOPOLY and press the "fork" button in the top right:

3. Clone your fork's main branch onto your local system:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your account name>/TERMINALMONOPOLY.git
```

4. Create a new branch with a descriptive (but short) title regarding what you're working on **(ensure your branch focuses on a specific, fully working feature e.g. documentation, implementing new authentication logic)**:

```sh
git checkout -b feature-name
```

Before submitting a pull request, write a couple (2-3) unit tests if applicable. If possible, follow the Test-Driven Development (TDD) paradigm, which involves writing tests before coding the feature itself. [Learn more about TDD here](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-test-driven-development).

5. Push your feature branch and submit a pull request (PR). That's it! Your code will be reviewed by a tech lead and if approved, merged into the main branch. Congrats on your contribution!

# Installation
Currently, Terminal Monopoly is still in-development. Check back in December 2024!

# Contributing
Interested in adding to Terminal Monopoly? This is a beginner-friendly project that anyone should feel welcome to work on. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started.

All code contributions should also be sure to adhere to the [style guide](StyleGuide.md).

The base Terminal Monopoly game will have a large collection of modules which should promote a large number of playstyles, but if you have ideas for modules, code them up and create a pull request! This game is always looking for creative additions. 

In the future, Terminal Monopoly may support "direct modding," that is, an interface will be available which will make module creation very simple.
